UCan’t plc operates a Christmas theme park where University students are employed at minimum
wage during the holidays to dress up as Elves and Santas. The park is organized so that after paying the hefty
entrance fee, children join a queue for a specific Grotto according to their age – the theory being
that they will receive an age-appropriate gift from one of several Santas. Unfortunately, UCan’t is facing 
financial difficulty and has decided to automate the sorting of gifts into sacks in the central 
“workshop” using his own patented machine, the services of several student Elves could be dispensed with!

In the new system, at the start of their shift, Elves will fill giant hoppers with randomly selected gifts. 
The hopper will feed the gifts at a predetermined rate onto a conveyor belt leading into the Sorting machine. 
The Sorting machine directs each gift along a sequence of conveyor belts and turntables, to be deposited in the
appropriate sack. When the machine has finished or the sacks are full, elves can deliver them in
a trolley to the appropriate grotto.

The ‘elf and safety union’ insist that a maximum number of gifts can be safely loaded into a sack
for an Elf to pick up at any one time, dependent on the Elf’s age and general fitness. The capacity
of each sack must therefore be clearly labelled in such a way that the machine knows how many
presents it can put into it.

Once started by the elf in charge, the machine will run for a set length of time. If the machine is
no longer able to direct presents into sacks because they are full, it will pause until either the timer
has run out, or an elf changes the full sack for an empty one.

Main task is to develop a simple Java simulation of the workings of the patent ‘Present Sorting Machine’, using Concurrency.
